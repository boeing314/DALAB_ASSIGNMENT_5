# A5: Yeast Dataset Analysis

This project analyzes the **Yeast dataset** using Python within a Jupyter Notebook.  
The dataset file `yeast.csv` should be placed in the same directory as the notebook (`assignment_5.ipynb`).

---

## Files
- **assignment_5.ipynb** → Jupyter Notebook with the full analysis.
- **yeast.csv** → Dataset used for analysis.

---

##  Dataset
The `yeast.csv` dataset contains biological data on protein localization sites.  
Each row corresponds to a yeast protein with multiple numerical features and a class label.

- **Features** → Numeric descriptors of proteins  
- **Target** → Protein localization site (categorical class)

For details, see the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/yeast).

---

## Requirements
To run the notebook, install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter
```

---

## How to Run
1. Place `yeast.csv` and `assignment_5.ipynb` in the same folder.
2. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook assignment_5.ipynb
   ```
3. Run all cells in sequence to reproduce the results.

## Analysis (Typical Steps)
- Data loading and cleaning  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Visualization of protein features  
- Machine learning classification models  
- Model evaluation and comparison
